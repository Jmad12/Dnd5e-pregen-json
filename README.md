My attempt at turning the 16 WoTC 5e pregens into Pauper's-Vault & VTTES Compatible Json

Have you ever wanted to start a Dungeons and Dragons 5e Campaign *right now*? Someone didnt bring a character to session 1? A new player joined the group last minute? Need some lvl 4 characters for a one shot?

Based on the [16 WoTC Pregens](https://dnd.wizards.com/charactersheets), this repo contains some characters for you to start a game of DnD 5e without going through character creation. Available from levels 1 to 10, these characters are compatible with [VTT Enhancement Suite](https://justas-d.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/)'s Character importer, for automatic importing into Roll20 games.

Wanna use one of these characters? Install [VTTES](https://justas-d.github.io/roll20-enhancement-suite/), Create a new character and overwrite it with the appropriate `.json`. Make sure you relink the token with the character sheet (through the `Represents Character` dropdown).

As of betteR20 v1.27.0, support for the Pauper's Character Vault was dropped. Some characters were imported with this tool, but will eventually be deleted.
