My attempt at turning the 16 WoTC 5e pregens into Pauper's-Vault-Compatible Json

Have you ever wanted to start a Dungeons and Dragons 5e Campaign *right now*? Someone didnt bring a character to session 1? A new player joined the group last minute? Need some lvl 4 characters for a one shot?

Based on the 16 WoTC Pregens found [here](https://dnd.wizards.com/charactersheets), this repo contains some characters for you to start a game of DnD 5e without going through character creation. These are compatible with [Better20](https://5e.tools/)'s Paupers Vault for automatic importing into Roll20 games.

Wanna use one of these characters? Install [Better20](https://5e.tools/), Download the .json that adapts to your choice of class and level, open the tool's list and use the Pauper's Characters Vault to upload your .json to Roll20.
